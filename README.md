# Comparative-Analysis-of-Human-Pose-Estimation-Models-for-Yoga-Poses

A spectrum of models for human pose estimation is explored,
featuring YOLOv8 for object detection and keypoint etimation,
MoveNet integrated with a RandomForest classifier, OpenPose
with a CNN, and MediaPipe with an SVC model. Each model
is meticulously selected to address specific challenges in human
pose estimation, underscoring the versatility of our approach.
This paper will be providing a comparison and analysis of the
used models and methodologies and ways the data was handled.
